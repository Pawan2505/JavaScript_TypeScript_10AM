// - while, do-While, for Loop

// Loop : same pattern of code is executed multiple times until a certain condition is met

// A. Entry Controlled Loops : first check the condition then execute the code block

// 1. For Loop : used when range is known 
    //  . starting point
    //  . ending point
    //  . increment / decrement

// 2. while Loop : used when range is not known
    // . only condition is provided

// B. Exit Controlled Loops : first execute the code block then check the condition

// 3. do-While Loop : same as while loop but at least one execution is guaranteed
// at first execution condition is not checked
